# Sound Effects

Place optional click/beep sound effects here:

- `click.mp3` - Button click sound (retro beep)

You can find retro computer sound effects from:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/
- Create your own with audio editing software

Keep sounds short (< 0.5s) and small file size for performance.
